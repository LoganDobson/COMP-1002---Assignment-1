                <p>I am a 20 year old Computer Programming student at Georgian College, I grew up in the small town of
                    Creemore Ontario, it is a town of about 1500 people and is most known for Creemore Springs. I grew
                    up with a love for video games which led me down the route of learning how to make them. I started
                    Coding in grade 10 when i took a Programming class and I really enjoyed coding and learning about
                    technology. I enjoy learning new things and expanding my knowledge in all areas and am willing to
                    learn whatever is neccessary to become successful.  </p>
